// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// Solution

function arrayDiff(a,b){
    return a.filter((number)=>!b.includes(number));

}
console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2]));
